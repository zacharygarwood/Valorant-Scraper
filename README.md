# Overview
Valorant Scraper is a web scraping application designed for the popular video game Valorant. It gathers statistics from people I played with and stores the cleaned data into a CSV.

The purpose behind the project, and visualizations of the data can be found out on my [website](https://zacharygarwood.com/projects/valorant_scraper)!
